1. Added some syntax sugar.

## 2022. 9. 20

1. Added some basic support for geometric calculations in the `math` library. Including:
- Data structure for lines, points (a type alias of `Vec2`), polygons.
- For lines, supports calculating the length of the line by simply calling a method `len()`.
- For polygons, supports detecting if a point is in the polygon or not. The default implementation use the **Winding Number Algorithm** to support any polygons. Rectangles have their own ways to do the hit test more efficiently, so I overrided the method for them.
