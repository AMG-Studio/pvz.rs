2. Project theme finally determined

The project creator *wgxh-cli* discussed with members. Eventually, the project roadmap determined as following:

> Inherit from PVZ 1, but we may be the greatest team.
>
> To help players to play conveniently, we have plugin system, this means player can change game content freely.
>
> And most contents of PVZ 1 will be changed in this version. Covers game properties, entity textures and UI and so on.

Hope for us!
